This blog is a set of pointers to news, blog posts, scientific articles, 
internet drafts, software and other types of information that would be
useful for students who have read the [Computer Networking: Principles,
Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be) ebook. 

Networking education has changed a lot during the last twenty years. When
a was still a student, before the invention of the web, students learned
most from the explanations of their professors and teachning assistants.
Additional information was available in scientific librairies, but it
was pretty difficult to find. Today's students live in a completely different
world. Computer networks and the Internet in particular have completely
changed our society. Students have access to much more information that
I could imagine when I was a student. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
provides lots of useful information, Internet drafts, RFCs and many 
scientific articles and open-source software within the reach of all
students provided that they understand the basics that enable them to
navigate in this deluge of information. Providing those basics becomes the
main objective of many university courses including the first networking
course. 

In July 2012, I created a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Computer-Networking-Principles-Protocols-and-Practice-129951043755620/about/?ref=page_internal) dedicated to [Computer Networking: Principles,
Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be) to inform students about noteworthy information on the evolution of the networking field in general. 
I've posted news and pointers on a regular basis on this [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Computer-Networking-Principles-Protocols-and-Practice-129951043755620/about/?ref=page_internal) but over the years, I became more and more frustrated by the Facebook's walled garden approach and all their attempts 
to monetize even a web page about an open-source ebook.

It's time to go back to pure web based services. Starting from the 2017-2018
academic year, all posts related to [Computer Networking: Principles,
Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be) will appear on this blog. Pointers will be posted on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Computer-Networking-Principles-Protocols-and-Practice-129951043755620/about/?ref=page_internal), but readers are strongly encouraged to use RSS readers to follow the posts instead of spending so much time on Facebook and other walled gardens disguised as social networks.
