Students and readers of the 
[Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols, and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook
know that the Domain Name System is one of the key protocols on today's Internet. A good interesting
of the DNS is key to correctly understand how the Internet operates and debug some networking problems.

[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) has a new very interesting project on [Implementing DNS in a weekend](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/12/introducing-implement-dns-in-a-weekend/). She explain how to build a complete DNS resolver from scratch in python. The pedagogical approach is very interesting and could probably be applied to other networking protocols.

[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) has presented a [nice 40 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsxjNsFu_2g) with a live demonstration on how she learned the DNS.

Peter Lowe describes in a detailed [blog post](https://labs.ripe.net/author/pgl/the-joy-of-txt/) the most frequent usages of the TXT records in the DNS.


Facebook released a [set of tools](https://github.com/facebookincubator/dns/tree/main/dnswatch) that allow to collect all the DNS requests made by applications on a Linux server. It leverages eBPF and other techniques to provide lots of information on the DNS queries that various applications execute.
