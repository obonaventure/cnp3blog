New types of denial of service attacks often reveal new details about deployed protocols or their implementations. The new HTTP/2 RST attacks that affected Google, AWS and CloudFlare and August 2023 and have been disclosed recently provide interesting information about some details of the [HTTP/2 protocol](https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/protocols/http2.html). Google and Cloudflare provide detailed the impact of this new attack on blog posts: [google's blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-it-works-the-novel-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack) and [cloudflare's blog][https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-day-rapid-reset-http2-record-breaking-ddos-attack/]

The attack exploits the fact that large web servers are usually behind proxies or load-balancers and that with HTTP/2, a client can send a request and reset it while it is still being processed by proxies or has been forwarded to servers.  If you want to understand the attack and HTTP/2 in more details, Lucas Pardue and Julien Desgats provide a [detailed technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/). Robin Marx also provides technical details and discusses [why HTTP/3 is not vulnerable to such attacks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rmarx\_youve-probably-heard-all-about-the-new-activity-7118229628464295936-cGOr?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop)

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Internet, google publishes an interesting [interview of Vint Cerf](https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/vint-cerf-on-50-years-of-the-internet-we-still-have-a-lot-of-work-to-do).
