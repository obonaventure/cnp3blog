As the Internet gets older, it is important to preserve artifacts from the early days to enable young students to understand the evolution of this network. A [new website]( https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/) presents some key artifacts showing the evolution of the Internet, starting with the [1977 map of the 
ARPANET](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/arpanet-map/), the [first MP3](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/first-mp3/), the [first webcam](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/xcoffee/), the [beginning of Wikipedia](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/wikipedia/), the [launch of Facebook](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/the-facebook/), ...

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to be a significant concern in today's Internet. The [Q3 2023 DDoS threat report](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-2023-q3/) published by Cloudflare provides some quantitative information about the evolution of this threat, with a peak DDoS attack of 2.6 Tbps towards 1.1.1.1. 

Some animations can summarize several years of measurements in a few minutes long video. A [nice youtube video shows the evolution of the IPv4 and IPv6 Internets in parallel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo5glK9czIE&t=2s). This is a nice video that illustrates the growth of IPv6 and its importance in presentations.
