To cross the oceans, the Internet mainly depends on transoceanic cables that
connect different countries across the oceans. A recent study indicates that
more than 500 of these cables have been deployed.

[Cnet](https://www.cnet.com) published a detailed article on [The secret life of the 500+ cables that run the Internet](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/features/the-secret-life-of-the-500-cables-that-run-the-internet/). This is an interesting read for students willing to understand the key aspects of these important cables that interconnect our continents.
