Internet Service Providers (ISP) and content providers exchange traffic using private and public Internet peering links. On these peering links, they rely on the [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/protocols/bgp.html) to exchange routing information. Various websites provide information about the peering links used by these ISPs, notably [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com/). [Anurag Bhatia](https://twitter.com/anurag_bhatia/) published on [twitter](https://twitter.com/anurag_bhatia/status/1663266621014659074?s=12) an interesting list of the top 25 ISPs with the largest public peering capacity :

The top 5 are :

 - [Akamai, AS20940](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/whois#w.resource=AS20940) with 41 Tbps
 - [Facebook, AS32934](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/whois#w.resource=AS32934) with 38 Tbps
 - [Amazon Web services AS16509](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/whois#w.resource=AS16509) with 35 Tbps
 - [Hurricane Electric AS6939](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/whois#w.resource=AS6939) with 29 Tbps
 - [Microsoft AS8075](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/whois#w.resource=AS8075) with 28 Tbps

Note that since this list is extracted from [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com), it ignores the private peerings and the transit links. Some ISPs have more peering capacity that mentioned in this list.
