Ethernet is now the ubiquitous fixed Local Area Network technology. This technology was invented by [Bob Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe) and [David Boggs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/technology/david-boggs-dead.html) at the Xerox'x Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to connect the ALTO workstations and the first laser printers. In 2021, Bob Metcalfe shared a [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/51l4x1p2e8lub5x/AABVgFyJ0fuia8QZt7SEZgBWa?dl=0) with several historical documents:

 - the seminal paper [Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/51l4x1p2e8lub5x/AABUFDRx_2DetFdJHHMcLezMa/EthernetPaper.pdf?dl=0-) published in Communications of the ACM
 - the first internal [Memo](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/51l4x1p2e8lub5x/AACsoKm3rI95OCNo1sTz3ORWa/EthernetInventionMemo.pdf?dl=0) on Ethernet that was published on May 22th, 1973, exactly fifty years ago
 - the first Ethernet "standard" or the [Blue book](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/51l4x1p2e8lub5x/AABVgFyJ0fuia8QZt7SEZgBWa?dl=0&preview=EthernetBlueBook.pdf) published by intel, Digital and Xeorx on September 30th, 1980

Earlier this year Bob Metcalfe received the [ACM Turing award](https://cacm.acm.org/careers/271168-acm-turing-award-honors-bob-metcalfe-for-ethernet/fulltext) for the invention of Ethernet. He gave a very interesting [keynote](https://www2023.thewebconf.org/program/live-stream-www/) at the web conference. 



This blog post was written to encourage the students who learned networking by reading the [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols, and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook to stay up to date and expand their knowledge of the networking technolgy.
