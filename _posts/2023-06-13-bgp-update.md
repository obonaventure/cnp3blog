The [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.ietf.org) continues to develop new extensions and improvements for the [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/protocols/bgp.html). BGP is used by more than 80k Internet Service Providers and enterprise networks of various sizes to exchange routing information.

Following all the discussions within the IETF on a specific can be time consuming, but still the new BGP extensions that are discussed in standardization committees can be important for network operators. On the mailing list of the [RIPE routing working group](https://www.ripe.net/participate/ripe/wg/active-wg/routing), Ignas Bagdonas published a very detailed and interesting summary of all the [recent discussions on BGP within the IETF](https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/routing-wg/2023-June/004748.html). This is an excellent source of information if you want to remain up-to-date on BGP.
