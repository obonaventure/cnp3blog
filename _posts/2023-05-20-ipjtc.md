Students and readers of the 
[Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols, and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook who want to stay up-to-date on the evolution of
the networking technology should subscribe to the [Internet Protocol Journal](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/). The first issue of this journal was published 25 years ago. Initially distributed on paper, it is now mainly available as pdf files from [https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/). Each issue contains very interesting tutorial articles that describe new protocols or discuss the evolution of networking technologies.

The last issue contains three interesting articles: 
- a tutorial on the ALTO protocol that enables applications to obtain information about the current state of the network
- a discussion on the implications of randomizing MAC addresses in Wi-Fi or Ethernet networks
- a reflection on the main changes that have affected the Internet during the last 25 years
