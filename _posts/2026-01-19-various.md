Cloudlfare provides more information about the TCP connections that they observe in their network in a [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/measuring-network-connections-at-scale/)


Philipp Tiesel has developed a new interactive website that allows companies to verify that their websites fully work for IPv6-only clients. Try it out at [https://webres6.dev.sap](https://webres6.dev.sap)

The [IPv6 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1883) is now 30 years old, much older than the students who follow the networking courses. 

Andra Lute describes briefly how [roaming works among cellular network operators](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andra-lutu-a8966637_viajar-con-mayor-conectividad-activity-7406660972880306176-G68W?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAA_wFcBtrzDYok3TgEsdsGk9Lnn1hU_xlI)

Ookla provides interesting information about the [performance of mobile networks in UK ](https://www.ookla.com/research/reports/uk-local-authorities-2025)

John Kristoff and Max Resing discuss [attacks on DNS root servers](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/dns-root-server-attacks)

Linux kernel developers rely on email to exchange patches to build the next version of the kernel. However, this email-based workflow is getting more and more fragile according to a recent [update](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251209-roaring-hidden-alligator-068eea@lemur/) by Konstantin Ryabitsev. 

Zi-Li Meng and his colleagues show that a student equipped with AI glasses can achieve excellent grades at a networking exam without any prior knowledge. They help students to answer exam questions. See https://xg.glass/posts/network-exam-test/

A [detailed description of Kimwolf](https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/), an emerging Android TV botnet that has already infected more than 1.8 million devices and can be used to launch DDoS attacks, is available. 

Cloudflare published its [state of the Internet report]( https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2025) for 2025.It provides many graphs showing the evolution of the web as seen from Cloudflare with metrics such as the adoption of the different versions of HTTP, IPv4 versus IPv6, the most popular browsers, but also the growth of AI bot traffic.

Netflix’s video streaming service generates a large amount of Internet traffic. This [blog post](https://netflixtechblog.com/av1-now-powering-30-of-netflix-streaming-02f592242d80) provides more details on the new video codecs used by Netflix.

What are the most popular Internet services ? Joao Tomé analyzes the DNS requests sent to the 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver to reveal the [most popular domain names in various categories](https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2025-year-in-review-internet-services/). 

Let’s Encrypt provides a large fraction of the TLS certificates used on the Internet. This democratization of TLS certificates was possible thanks to the adoption of the ACME protocol. Christophe Brocas explains the evolution of this protocol in an [interesting blog post](https://blog.brocas.org/2025/12/01/ACME-a-brief-history-of-one-of-the-protocols-which-has-changed-the-Internet-Security/)

[RFC9460](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9460.html) defined the HTTPS and SVBC DNS resource records in November 2023. More than two years later, Jan Schaumann [discusses](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/https-caniuse.html) the support for these records by different browsers.

A new edition of the book [The Data Center as a Computer - Designing Warehouse-Scale Machines](
https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-99489-0) by Luiz André Barroso , Urs Hölzle, and Parthasarathy Ranganathan has been published as an open book. This is a recommended reading if you wish to understand the design principles of Google’s datacenters.

Andrew Cooks explains how to use [tshark to detect various types of problems](https://www.rationali.st/blog/diagnosing-video-stuttering-over-tcp/) when streaming video over TCP.

The Ultra Ethernet specification describes how Ethernet can be enhanced to support datacenters that need to support large AI or HPC workloads. A recent [arXiv report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08906) describes the main principles of this new technology. The authors also presented a [two-hour tutorial](https://youtu.be/0dsRrHIWiGg?si=PVPPvVhKrqCwuV56) on this topic.

Antonio Prato has released a website, [https://ping6.it/](https://ping6.it/) which allows one to compare the latency over IPv6 and IPv4 from multiple vantage points to reach a given destination.

2026 could be the year when wireless mesh networks from different vendors become interoperable thanks to the [Thread 1.4 specification](https://spectrum.ieee.org/mesh-network-interoperable-thread) that unifies wireless mesh approaches.

[ttl](https://github.com/lance0/ttl) is a modern replacement for traceroute that collects multiple metrics.
