Certification Authorities (CA) play an important role in today's Internet as they provide the certificates used by TLS servers. There are many different CAs that provide different types of certificates. [Matthew McPherrin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcpherrinm/) extracted information from Firefox telemetry to determine the popularity of the different CAs. His analysis shows that a few of CAs dominate the market according to the firefox users.
