The Internet is a dynamic system that evolves over the years. This
evolution can be observed from several vantage points. A recent
article, entitled
[Five Years at the Edge: Watching Internet from the ISP Network](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3281433)
and co-authored by
[Martino Trevisan](http://www.telematica.polito.it/public/phd-and-post-docs/martino-trevisan)
and his colleagues from Politechnico di Torino provides an unusual and
very interesting perpective on the evolution of Internet traffic. This
paper was presented last week at the
[Conext'2018](https://conferences2.sigcomm.org/co-next/2018)
and can be downloaded from the [conference program page](https://conferences2.sigcomm.org/co-next/2018/#!/program)

During the last five years, they have collected the packets exchanged
by several thousands of home users attached to ADSL and FTTH
links to an Italian ISP. These collected packets were then analysed by
using [tstat](http://www.tstat.polito.it) and specialised software.

They provide a wide range of measurements that cannot be summarised in
a short blog post. Here are two examples that are very
interesting. They first analyse the distribution of the traffic
sent/receive daily per user and compare the results during the
different years. The heavy-tail of this distribution is expected, but
the difference between ADSL (1-20 Mbps download) and FTTH (100 Mbps
download) is surprising. In 2017, ADSL users consumed more data than
FTTH users in 2014. The current applications clearly encourage data transfers.

A second very interesting figure is the evolution of the web protocols
during the last five years. In 2013, 90% of the web traffic used
HTTP. Today, HTTP covers less than 30% of the web traffic. HTTPS,
i.e. HTTP over TLS, is now more important than HTTP. HTTP/2 and QUIC
correspond to about 10% of the web traffic while SPDY has completely
disappeared. Finally, Facebook zero has grown to 10% of the traffic in
less than a year. Large content providers can heavily influence the
evolution of web traffic.
