title: How does NAT (Network Address Translation) supports ping ?

Most IPv4 Internet accesses are behind NAT ([Network Address Translation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1631.html) boxes. While students easily learn how NAT translate packets from [TCP](https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/protocols/tcp.html?highlight=tcp) connections or UDP (https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/protocols/udp.html?highlight=udp) flows, the interactions between NAT and the [Internet Control Message Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc792) is more complex.

A recent [blog post](https://devnonsense.com/posts/how-does-linux-nat-a-ping/) provides a nice discussion of these interactions with code demonstrating how to experiment with NAT on Linux as well as packet traces. This could be the basis for a nice lab for students willing to understand NAT in more details.
