The [Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS)](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/2nd/html/protocols/tls.html) plays a growing role in today's Internet by securing many key application layer protocols. Since the publication of version 1.3 of TLS in [RFC8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446), it is interesting to track the deployment of this new version. This post provides pointers to recent articles and blog posts that are directly related to the evolution of TLS and could be of interest to the readers of [Computer Networking : Principles, Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be).

 - David Wong published an interesting [readable version] (https://davidwong.fr/tls13/) of [RFC8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446) that includes more figures and removes some of the uglier details of [RFC8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)
 - Hanno Bock gave a [detailed presentation of TLS 1.3](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9607-the_rocky_road_to_tls_1_3_and_better_internet_encryption#t=252) at the Chaos Computer Club in December
 - The BBC [announced on Twitter]( <https://twitter.com/tdp_org/status/1082303286198353923?s=12) that they have enabled TLS 1.3 on their main servers
 - During January 2019, a growing number of US government websites [used expired TLS certificates](https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/government-shutdown-tls-certificates-not-renewed-many-websites-are-down/) because of the shutdown caused by the fight between Donald Trump and the Congress
 - Apple [announced](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/5QjzTilqjomSyzENtgfaAqQOhbA) that TLS1.3 would be included in iOS122
 - David McGrew posted an interesting post on [how to fingerprint TLS client implementations](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fingerprinting-tls-client-implementations-david-mcgrew/) with a database of these fingerprints. For TLS 1.3, Marting Thomson maintains a list of the known implementations on [https://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/wiki/Implementations](https://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/wiki/Implementations)
