title: A successful student project: analyzing popular websites

Most computer networking classes in universities include lab sessions and projects that enable students to learn how protocols are used in the real worl. For almost a decade, I've asked the students who follow the networking course at [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be) to analyze one web site. This project idea was suggested by Gisueppe Di Battista who also teaches computer networking at Roma III university.

Students spend a lot of time interacting with websites, but they rarely know how websites operate. Once they have learned the basics of DNS, HTTP and TLS, I ask them to select a website that they use and analyze it in details. Each student writes a four-pages report that describes his/her technical findings. Here are some sample student reports from last year. Unfortunately, most of them are in French.

There is a brief description of this project in [Scaling Networking Education with Open Educational Resources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06910.pdf). It can be easily adapted to various networking classes.
