[cURL](https://curl.se) and [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org) are among the command-line tools that networking students need to master. Two recent blog posts provide excellent summaries of many use cases of using these tools.


[cURL](https://curl.se) is a command-line tool that supports a wide range of application-layer protocols even if it is mainly known for its HTTP support. [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se), the author of [cURL](https://curl.se)  created a 3.5 hours [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5vZWHP-RqU) with examples of the most important usages of cURL. If you prefer this information in textual format, [Anton Zhiyanov](https://antonz.org) summarized most of the video in a long [blog post](https://antonz.org/mastering-curl/).

[tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org) is the standard tool to collect packet traces and dissect the protocols that are used in the captured packets. [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/) wrote an [interesting article](https://danielmiessler.com/p/tcpdump/) describing many of the common use cases for tcpdump.
