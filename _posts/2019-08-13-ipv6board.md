The large size of the IPv6 addresses enables unexpected use cases and nice demos. Using a Raspberry PI, Markus Klock has designed an open IPv6 board where anyone can write short messages by sending IPv6 ICMP packets. The raspberry listens to IPv6 prefix 2001:6b0:1001:105::/64 and captures any packet sent to this prefix. To write a message on the board, simply encode the ASCII characters as the low order 64 bits of the address that you ping.

For example, to write !*!*!*!* on the board, you first convert the text in ASCII format (! is 21 in hexadecimal and * 2A) and then create the IPv6 address that includes these characters. The message can be written on the board with the following command.

```
ping6 2001:6b0:1001:105:212A:212A:212A:212A
PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) 2001:6a8:308f:2:8c36:3243:81e0:4f5e --> 2001:6b0:1001:105:212a:212a:212a:212a
^C
--- 2001:6b0:1001:105:212A:212A:212A:212A ping6 statistics ---
```
Shortly later, the IPv6 board will show your text

The [IPv6 board](https://ipv6board.best-practice.se) streams the output of the board on YouTube live, see an example below.
