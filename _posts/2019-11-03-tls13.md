Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by a growing number of applications in today's Internet. While updating the TLS chapter of the `third edition <http://beta.computer-networking.info>`_ of `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice <https://www.computer-networking.info>`_, I had to look at interesting articles on TLS and version 1.3 in particular. Some of them could be very useful for readers of the e-book:

 - In `TLS Beyond the Browser: Combining End Host and Network Data to Understand Application Behavior` that was presented recently at `IMC 2019 <https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2019/program/>`_, Blake Anderson and David Mc Grew provide a very detailed analysis of the evolution of the TLS ecosystem based on data collected in many networks. A very interesting result is Figure 6 that shows that the fraction of the observed TLS connections for different applications over time.

 - Eric Rescorla, the editor of the TLS 1.3 specification gave a very detailed and interesting seminar in 2015 at Stanford. In his talk, he highlights the key components of this new protocol. The recordings are available on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grRi-aFrbSE
 - The `Illustrated TLS Connection <https://tls.ulfheim.net>`_ is an interactive website that describes in details a TLS 1.2 handshake. A similar website has been developed for TLS 1.3, you can check it at https://tls13.ulfheim.net
