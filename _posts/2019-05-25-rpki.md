The security of interdomain routing has been an important operational problem
for many years and several BGP errors have affected the global Internet, including the famous [AS7007 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_7007_incident) or the [Youtube hijack](https://www.ripe.net/publications/news/industry-developments/youtube-hijacking-a-ripe-ncc-ris-case-study). Many smaller BGP errors or misconfigurations occur regularly as shown in a [blog post by Andrei Robachevsky](https://www.manrs.org/2019/02/routing-security-getting-better-but-no-reason-to-rest/).


The Internet community has considered various solutions to secure the announcement of BGP routes. A first approach was [S-BGP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/839934) that added cryptographic capabilities to the [BGP protocol](https://www.computer-networking.info/2nd/html/protocols/bgp.html) but it was considered to be too complex to implement and deploy on routers. Over the years, the networking community adopted a more pragmatic approach, the RPKI. This approach is inspired by the success of using X.509 certificates to authenticate [TLS](https://www.computer-networking.info/2nd/html/protocols/tls.html) servers . In the RPKI, the Regional Internet Registries that allocate block of IP addresses serve as certificate authorities that authorise a given AS to advertise a block of IP addresses that they have allocated to this AS. The technical details are defined in [RFC5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) and [RFC3779](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3779), but the the [RPKI Documentation](https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a much more readable document.

A [growing number of ISPs have deployed RPKI](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/state-of-rpki-in-2018). The Netherlands leads with 93 different ASes in 2018. Roland van Rijswijk-Deij presented a [detailed overview of the evolution of the RPKI during almost the last decade](https://ripe78.ripe.net/presentations/145-20190524-RIPE-78-Ziggy.pdf) with data collected by RIPE NCC at [RIPE78](https://ripe78.ripe.net/).  It will take some time to deploy the RPKI throughout the entire Internet, but the deployment progresses well.

One way to encourage the deployment of the RPKI is to use the [RPKI web test](http://sg-pub.ripe.net/jasper/rpki-web-test) to verify whether your ISP uses the RPKI. If not, do not hesitate to contact their customer support and ask them to deploy this useful technology. The networks that I use at home and at work do not yet use the RPKI, but I hope that this will change soon...
