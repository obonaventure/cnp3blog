Measurements always reveal new insights or unexpected results about the
system under study. This applies to a wide range of systems including
the Internet. Two recent scientific articles provide unexpected results
about two very different protocols: ICMP and BGP.

[ICMP](https://www.computer-networking.info/2nd/html/protocols/ipv6.html#icmp-version-6) is a network layer protocol that is used by routers to provide
feedback to sources about the transmission of the packets. It is used by
applications such as traceroute, ping or solutions like Path MTU Discovery
defined in [RFC8201](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8201.html). Recently,
researchers in Aachen who probe the entire IPv4 addressing space to track
the utilisation of specific protocols, looked at the ICMP messages that
they received. As expected, they observed standard destination unreachable or
port unreachable messages. In [Hidden Treasures - Recycling Large-Scale Internet Measurements to Study the Internet's Control Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07265v1), Jan Ruth, Torsten Zimmermann, and Oliver Hohlfeld discuss a wide range of ICMP messages that they observed. If you like to dig into unexpected
measurement results, I'd encourage you to have a look at this paper.

[BGP](https://www.computer-networking.info/2nd/html/protocols/bgp.html) is that standard interdomain routing protocol. When a BGP router announces a new prefix,
the corresponding route is propagated towards all BGP routers in the public
Internet. If later this router stops announcing the prefix, then the corresponding
route will be removed from all other BGP routers in the public Internet. In a
recent paper entitled [BGP Zombies: an Analysis of Beacons Stuck Routes](https://www.iij-ii.co.jp/en/members/romain/pdf/romain_pam2019.pdf), Romain Fontugne and his colleagues analyse the problem of BGP zombies, routes that have been removed by their origin router but still exist in some parts of the Internet.
These BGP Zombies are probably caused by some bugs in routers which could
explain the fact that some routes are not totally removed. Romain also wrote an interesting [blog post](https://blog.apnic.net/2019/05/01/bgp-zombies/) summarizing the key results of the paper. These are interesting sources of information to better understand the BGP protocol.
