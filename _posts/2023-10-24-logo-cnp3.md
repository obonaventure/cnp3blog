When the first edition of [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) was published, I quickly created a simple logo using keynote and hoped that someone would propose better ideas. Ten years later, the old log is still there...

With the new AI-based tools, it becomes simpler to create fancy drawings and logos. I spent a few minutes with Bing's Dall-E and got two interesting ideas. The first one used the prompt : *a poster to promote a book entitled "computer networking: principles, protocols and practice"*. It features students and shows a large network.

The second one used a longer prompt: *a poster to promote a book cover title "computer networking: principles, protocols and practice" and showing an internet service provider network with routers connected to switches and servers*. The result is different.

I encourage the readers of this blog to explore other ideas and submit their best logo as a pull request on [https://github.com/cnp3/ebook/pulls](https://github.com/cnp3/ebook/pulls) for inclusion in the next edition of the book. It could also be nice to have illustrations for the different chapters.
