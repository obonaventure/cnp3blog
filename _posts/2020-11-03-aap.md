A recent [blog post on APNIC](https://blog.apnic.net/2020/10/29/find-bugs-in-your-dns-zone-files-before-deployment/) describes GRoot, a tool that checks various DNS configuration and zone files for errors. Would be very useful if you need to maintain DNS servers.

[circleid](https://circleid.com) published an interesting article written by Geoff Huston on [Scaling the Root of the DNS](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20200926-scaling-the-root-of-the-dns/).

The IETF published [RFC8932](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8932.txt) which provides privacy recommendations for DNS operators. If you reach French, you can also read an [excellent summary]( https://www.bortzmeyer.org/8932.html) of this RFC by St√©phane Bortzmeyer.

If you use Chromium, you probably like its auto-suggestion feature. When you type the first characters of a domain name in the address bar, this browsers tries to consider this as either a search term or a domain name. To verify whether the letters that you typed are a valid domain name, it simply queries the DNS. Unfortunately, these queries are responsible for 50% of the load of the root DNS servers according to a [post on the APNIC blog](https://blog.apnic.net/2020/08/21/chromiums-impact-on-root-dns-traffic/). 

The HTTP Working Group of the IETF is currently revising the [HTTP caching specification](https://cache-tests.fyi/spec/cache.html). Caches are a key element of the HTTP protocol. While working on this revising, Mark Notthigham has developed a nice visualisation that indicates how different browsers support this IETF draft. These visualizations are linked from the IETF draft itself !
