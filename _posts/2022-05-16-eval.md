Students and readers of the 
[Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols, and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook
often ask for exercises to enable them to evaluate their understanding of the different topics discussed in
the ebook. Over the years, we have added various exercises on the [INGInious](https://www.inginious.org).
In the framework of their ongoing Master thesis, Clément Linsmeau and Matthieu Leclercq have developed
an [INGInious](https://www.inginious.org) extension that uses statistical techniques to evaluate the
students using simple questions. Their [INGInious](https://www.inginious.org) suggests a series of about a
dozen of exercises to each student to evaluate hir/her knowledge. The exercises that are selected
depend on the answers given by each student to each exercise. A brigth student will receive a set
of challenging exercises to see whether she/he really masters the course while an average student
will receive simpler exercises.
