The [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols, and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook continues to evolve in paralle with Internet technology. During the 2022-2023 academic year, [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be) experimented with a new way of organizing the teaching material. Instead of using a top-down or a bottom approach as most networking books do, we divided the course in two parts. The first part covers the protocols that are used by the endhosts and the network is
considered as a blackbox. This part starts with the applications that the students already use. The second part focus on the network infrastructure with the routing protocols and the local area networks.

A new set of slides is available. They have been posted on slideshare:

 - [Part 1: Introduction and Internet applications](https://www.slideshare.net/obonaventure/part1introappspptx-257981736)

The next step will be to rewrite the ebook to follow this new organisation of the teaching material.
