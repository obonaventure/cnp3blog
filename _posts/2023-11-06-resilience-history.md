Robbie Michell published an [interesting study](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/blog/dont-put-all-your-internet-infrastructure-in-one-basket) of the resilience of the Internet infrastructure in Bangladesh after a fire disrupted significantly Internet access in this country. This reminds us of the importance of having a diversity of Internet providers and infrastructure to serve a city or country.

The continued Internet growth puts a pressure on the IPv4 addresses. During the last years, the cost of acquiring IPv4 addresses has increased steadily. A [recent study](https://www.sidn.nl/en/news-and-blogs/are-we-past-peak-ipv4) indicates that we might have reached a plateau in the price of IPv4 addresses. Hopefully, this is because IPv6 gets more widely deployed...  

Looking back in the past, the end of October and the beginning of November have been important in the Internet history. The paper that lead the foundation for TCP/IP, [A protocol for Packet Networking Intercommunication](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf), co-authored by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, was submitted on November 5th, 1973, fifty years ago. Ten years later, Paul Mockapetris published [RFC822](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc882.txt) describing the basis for the Domain Name System. Five years later, on November 2nd, 1988, a worm started to spread over the Internet. This was the first of a series of unfortunately too long list of security problems that have affected the Internet. Eugene Spafford, who analyzed the Internet worm, provides [useful pointers](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/blog/post/reflecting_on_the_internet_worm_at_35/) on this important event.

If you seek networking resources, Matthew Caesar and his students have created a [nice website](https://openlibrary.cs.illinois.edu/) that collects lots of pointers to software, courses, videos and other types of resources for networking students. 

This blog aims at encouraging students who read the open [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook to explore new networking topics.
