Web browsers are probably one of the most widely used applications on desktops and smartphones. While Google Chrome is [currently the dominant web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers), users can decide to install different web browsers to improve their experience or for other reasons like privacy concerns, performance issues, ... 

A recent series of posts by [Jonathan Sampson](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson) takes a very interesting viewpoint by looking at what different browsers actually do when they are installed on a new machine. For this, he installed a proxy that intercepts all the requests made by the fresh browser and analyses its logs. The results are both surprising and interesting. Surprising because some browsers send a lot of requests to various web sites that are not directly related to the company that controls the browser. Interesting, because [Jonathan Sampson](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson) analyses all these requests in details. Here are the pointers to the analyses of the different browsers:


 - [What happens when Apple Safari launches with a new profile?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1166462700794388481)
 - [What happens when you instal the Edge beta browser?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1166138692509065218)
 - [What happens when you install the Opera browser?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1165353213308129281)
 - [What happens when you install the Vivaldi browser?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1165358155922059266)
 - [What happens when you install the Brave browser?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1165391211999518720)
 - [What happens when you install the Chrome browser?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1165493206441779200)
 - [What happens when you install the Firefox browser?](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1165858896176660480)


From this analysis, it is clear that some browsers could be optimized to perform fewer requests to external domains.
