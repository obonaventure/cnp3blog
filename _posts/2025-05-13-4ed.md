title: Preparing a fourth edition of the Computer Networking ebook

During the last two years, we have experimented a different organization of the first networking
course at UCLouvain. Most networking courses use either:
 - a bottom-up approach starting from the physical layer and then going up the stack
 - a top-down approach starting from the application layer and then going down the stack

The previous editions of [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info)
used a mixed approach, starting from the principles and then exploring the Internet protocols.
Our students expressed some frustation with this approach as it forced them to wait several
weeks before studying real protocols.

During the last two years, we adopted a different approach which seems to work pretty well with
our students. The course is now divided in two main parts:
 - the host part describes the protocols that are used by hosts, assuming the network as a blackbox
 - the network part describes the protocols used by routers and switches


We have prepared a set of slides that follow this approach and work well with our students.

 - the [first course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part1-Intro-Apps.pptx) starts with an introduction and a description of the applications
 - the [second course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part2-Apps-Security.pptx) continues our exploration of the applications and explains the security principles
 - the [third course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part3-reliable.pptx) explains the principles of reliable transfert with go-back-n and selective repeat
 - the [fourth course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part4-reliable-tcp.pptx) explains the principles of reliable transport and the basics of TCP
 - the [fifth course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part5-tcp-improvements.pptx) describes modern TCP implementations
 - the [sixth course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part6-QUIC.pptx) explains the principles of QUIC, which is now widely deployed and provides a modern and secure transport protocol
 - the [seventh course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part7-network-routing.pptx) describes the network layer on the hosts and the distance vector and link-state routing protocols
 - the [eighth course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part8-routing.pptx) describes the intra and interdomain routing protocols
 - the [nineth course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part9-ibgp-sr.pptx) describes how BGP is used inside ISP networks
  - the [tenth course]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part10-congestion.pptx) describes how congestion is handled by transport protocols and how routers can control the traffic that passes through them
  - the [eleventh and twelveth courses]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Part12-lan.pptx) describe Ethernet and WiFi and discuss how IP operates in LANs

The next step is now to convert this organization into an ebook which is reusable by various universities. In the mean time, the slides are already available through the above links.


Suggestions and comments on this approach are more than welcome !
