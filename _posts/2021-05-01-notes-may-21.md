Welcome to the May 2021 edition of the Networking Notes newsletter.

This newsletter gathers the most recent news about the evolution
of the networking field. Its main objective is to inform the students
who have read the [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook about the evolution of the field.

You can [subscribe to this newsletter](http://blog.computer-networking.info/notes/).

# The CNP3 ebook 

The beta version of the third edition of [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](https://beta.computer-networking.info) is an interactive ebook that includes various online exercises. These exercises are open-source like the entire ebook and during the last week of August, we will organize a hackathon during [SIGCOMM'21(https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/) to create new open exercises for networking students. More details will be provided in the coming weeks.


# Generic networking

For more than one year, the covid pandemic has impact all aspects of
our life. A
[recent report](https://www.bitag.org/documents/bitag_report.pdf)
published by the
[Broadband	Internet	Technical	Advisory	Group	(BITAG)](https://www.bitag.org)
summarises some interesting data about how the usage of different
types of networks has changed during the pandemic.

Link failures happen regularly in networks. Most are due to the
failure of networking equipment. However, some have unexpected root
causes. In Canada, beavers [have cut optical fibers](https://earther.gizmodo.com/internet-outage-in-canada-blamed-on-beavers-gnawing-thr-1846760780)
and took down Internet service for 900 users.

Some countries are tried different approaches to control or censor
social networks. The most recent example is Russia that throttled
twitter. Throttling, i.e. reducing the allocated bandwidth, is clever
than simply blocking the IP addresses used by the social network, but
not easy to do at a country
level. [Researchers provide many details](https://censoredplanet.org/throttling)
on how this throttling works. This is an interesting for application
developers or hacktivists who would like to circumvent such
censorship. 


# Network protocols

## Application layer


The first version of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was described
in [RFC114](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114) published in 1971. The protocol continued to evolve as shown in a recent [blog post](https://www.filestash.app/2021/04/16/ftp-is-50-years-old/).

### DNS

A recent [article](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/241-ipj-1.pdf) written by Geoff Huston in the [Internet Protocol Journal](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/) looks at the evolution of the Internet's naming infrastructure.


DNS is a critical part of the Internet infrastructure and bad
performance of DNS servers/resolvers could hurt the performance of
many entreprise or ISP networks. As these networks deploy new DNS
features such as DNS over TLS (DoT) or DNS over HTTPS (DoH), it might
be useful to verify the performance of their DNS servers/resolvers
using benchmark tools such as [DNS shotgun](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/04/06/introducing-dns-shotgun/).

### HTTP

Commercial web servers use HTTP Cookies for various reasons. Some
cookies simply encode user preferences on a single web
site. Unfortunately, these HTTP Cookies have been overused to track
users from one website to another and some websites include trackers
from dozens of companies. Companies that heavily rely on such HTTP
Cookies have started to explored other ways to track users. A recent
attempt is Google's Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC). Google has already
started to deploy this approach to some users despite
[concerns](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/google-testing-its-controversial-new-ad-targeting-tech-millions-browsers-heres)
raised by privacy advocates like [EFF](https://www.eff.org). You can
check whether your Google Chrome browsers uses this extension on
[https://amifloced.org/](https://amifloced.org/). [Brave](https://brave.com),
a browser based on Chrome, has
[removed FLoC from their latest browsers](https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/). [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com)
also announced their plans to [block FLoC on WordPress sites](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wordpress-to-automatically-disable-google-floc-on-websites/).

In parallel, T-Mobile announced that they would [sell web usage data](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/t-mobile-will-tell-advertisers-how-you-use-the-web-starting-next-month/?utm_source=twitter&utm_brand=ars&utm_medium=social&utm_social-type=owned) of
their customers unless they opt out. Cellular providers explore new
sources of revenue, but selling user usage data does not seem the
right approach.


Web browsers collect statistics from many users. Mozilla releases some
of the statistics collected by Firefox on its measurement
dashboard. Looking at HTTP, it is interesting to
[observe](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/new-pipeline/dist.html#!cumulative=0&end_date=2021-04-06&include_spill=0&keys=__none__!__none__!__none__&max_channel_version=nightly%252F89&measure=HTTP_RESPONSE_VERSION&min_channel_version=null&processType=*&product=Firefox&sanitize=1&sort_by_value=0&sort_keys=submissions&start_date=2021-03-22&table=0&trim=1&use_submission_date=0)
that firefox users rarely use HTTP/1.0. About 30% of the requests use
HTTP/1.1, slightly less than 50% HTTP/2.0 and
already 20% use HTTP/3 over QUIC.


### TLS

TLS is used by a large number of applications. Over the years, one can
expect that most of the Internet traffic will be encrypted and
authenticated using
TLS. [TCPLS](https://pluginized-protocols.org/tcpls/) goes one step
further by closely integrating TCP and TLS together. A recent
[blog post](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/04/15/introducing-tcpls-a-game-of-transport-protocols/)
provides a nice introduction to TCPLS.

HTTPS has replaced HTTP on most public websites. Many of these
websites use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) that simplified
the provisioning of TLS certificates on websites. While HTTPS would
also be very useful inside home networks, it can be difficult to
obtain the required certificates. A [recent blog](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/27316) post describes how to
use a reverse proxy to solve this problem. canHowever, many private
websites inside entreprises still use HTTP. A 
https://isc.sans.edu/diary/27316

## Transport layer

The [Datagram Congestion Control (DCCP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4340)
is a transport protocol that was designed to transport datagrams
unreliably. DCCP is rarely used, but is still included in operating
systems such as Linux and thus available on a wide range of
devices. This has apparently attracted attackers as a
[recent report](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2021/03/threat-advisory---dccp-for-ddos.html)
shows that there are DDoS attacks using DCCP packets.


## Networking layer

### IPv6

IPv6 continues to be deployed and several studies analyze its
deployment. A French website, [lafibre.info](https://lafibre.info)
combines these four sources of data to provide per-country statistics
on
[https://lafibre.info/ipv6/ipv6-pays/](https://lafibre.info/ipv6/ipv6-pays/). Some
countries manage to deploy IPv6 faster than others. The latest [example
is Saudi Arabia](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/blog/5126).

IPv6 routers do not fragment IPv6 packets that are too large to be
transmitted over a link with a small MTU. The IPv6 protocol relies on
a specific header to allow a host to fragment its packets before
sending them. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to correctly
implement IPv6 fragmentation. Despite more than a decade of experience
with deployed IPv6, we still discover some security issues in IPv6
stack. A
[detailed analysis](https://blog.quarkslab.com/analysis-of-a-windows-ipv6-fragmentation-vulnerability-cve-2021-24086.html)
describes in details a recent bug in the Windows IPv6 stack.

While IPv6 fragmentation is a standard part of IPv6, there are routers
and firewalls that block IPv6 fragments for security reasons,
including fear of attacks using fragments or the above problem.
A recent [measurement study](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/04/23/ipv6-fragmentation-loss-in-2021/)
shows that there are large parts of the Internet where fragments do
not go through. Another reason to avoid using IPv6 fragments...


### Interdomain routing (BGP)

With the RPKI, ISPs are taking a first and important step to prevent
all the problems that have been caused by networks announcing BGP
prefixes that they do not own. A
[recent blog post](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/04/08/common-pitfalls-in-rpki-deployment-and-how-to-avoid-them/)
summarises some lessons learned from using the RPKI. This did not
prevent a
[large prefix hijack from Vodafone](https://anuragbhatia.com/2021/04/networking/isp-column/large-prefix-hijack-from-vodafone-as55410/). The
[MANRS project](https://www.manrs.org/)
that encourages the deployment of Routing Security project also
[analyzes this hijack](https://www.manrs.org/2021/04/a-major-bgp-hijack-by-as55410-vodafone-idea-ltd/).

There are some situations where network operators have some
non-transient loops in their networks. A
[recent blog post](https://toonk.io/the-risks-and-dangers-of-amplified-routing-loops/)
argues that these loops could be exploited by attackers to amplify
DDoS attacks.

On March 23 2021, the London Internet eXchange Point (LINX) suffered
from [several problems](https://www.linx.net/resources/incidents-log/)
on a part of its network. This caused huge traffic shits. Emile Aben
provides a
[detailed analysis of this event using public data](https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/does-the-internet-route-around-damage-edition-2021/).

BGP is a routing protocol where routers exchange incremental updates,
i.e. they only advertise changes to their routing tables. In theory,
if the origin of a BGP route ceases to announce this prefix, the route
should eventually disappear from all Internet routers. Unfortunately,
some such BGP routes, called BGP zombies, are not correctly withdrawn
and remain in the routing tables of BGP routers in parts of the
Internet. A recent blog post provides an [interesting experiment
showing that BGP zombies still exist and proposes a possible
explanation](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-stuck-routes-tcp-zero-window). 

Some organisations own large IPv4 prefixes that they do not advertise
on the public Internet. In the early days of the Internet, large
blocks of the IPv4 addressing space (221,828,864 addresses) were
allocated to the US Army. Nobody really knows whether these IPv4 addresses were actually
used, but network operators were very surprised to see an unknown
company advertise these blocks of IPv4 addresses. Some argued
that this block of addresses could used to create another [network
telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_telescope) to track
ongoing attacks. You can find additional information in a [blog post](
https://blog.apnic.net/2021/04/27/ipv4-in-the-headlines/) and a
[magazine article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/pentagon-explains-odd-transfer-of-175-million-ip-addresses-to-obscure-company/?utm_brand=arstechnica&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&utm_medium=social).


# Physical layer

With the deployment a new satellite-based services like Starlink,
Oneweb and others we could have several satellite constellations above
our heads in the combing years. Some of these low-orbit satellites are
sometimes visible from the ground provided that one looks in the right
direction at the right time. A
[recent web application](https://james.darpinian.com/satellites/)
allows you to plan your next satellite observation through a nice
application that leverages Street View to show you where to look at.

Data transmission networks existed before the invention of computers
and later computer networks. Besides the telegraphs and other early
networks described in
[The early history of data networks](https://archive.org/details/earlyhistoryofda0000holz)
there were other types of networks. Companies and cities used
pneumatic networks to quickly exchange written notes. In Paris, the
pneumatic network created in 1866 spanned 15 kms. The
French television celebrated the 100th anniversary of this network in
1966 with a [three minutes movie](https://www.ina.fr/video/CAF97061464).

# Software and tools


The Linux TCP/IP stack is one of the most widely used TCP/IP
implementation these days. The stack is complex and includes a large
number of functions. When exploring the kernel code, it is often
useful to be able to trace the functions that are executed to perform
a specific
task. [ipftrace2](https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/ipftrace2) allows
to trace how specific packets are processed by the various functions
of the Linux kernel.



Many users measure the performance of their cellular or home networks
by using websites that try to serve large files as quickly as possible
and then use short flows to report latency
measurements. Unfortunately, these tests are not representative for
most applications. Applications rarely need to exchange huge
files. Many applications would like to have a network that has enough
available bandwidth to transfert the blocks of data that it produces
with a low and stable latency. For many applications, spikes in
latency are much more problematic as soon as the throughput is above a
few tens of Mbps. A
[recent report](https://www.netradar.com/the-netradar-hybrid-measurement-technology/)
argues for hybrid measurements, i.e. measurements of latency and
latency variations while applications actually run. 

Network congestion typically happens on some parts of the network, e.g. low-speed access links or overloaded peering links. When the network does not perform as expected, it can be useful for users to try to isolate where packet losses occur. [Mtr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTR_(software)) is a variant of traceroute that sends probes to identify where packet losses occur. A [recent blog post](https://karneliuk.com/2021/04/tools-6-where-are-my-packets-lost-mtr-edition/) describes some use cases for mtr.
