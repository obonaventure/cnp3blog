title: This could be the main motivation to deploy IPv6 on servers and in enterprise networks

The IPv6 deployment continues globally. The measurements carried by Google and others indicate that IPv6 is now widely used in access networks, both fixed and wireless ones. Many home users use both IPv4 and IPv6 without knowing that there are two different versions of IP. In enterprise networks, IPv4 is still the dominant protocol and enterprises have been relunctant to deploy IPv6 with some exceptions.

In parallel enterprises rely more and more on cloud-based services and some of them have also moved their servers to the cloud. Most cloud provides supported only IPv4 initially and many of these services and servers use IPv4 addresses. However, it's getting more difficult for cloud providers to obtain IPv4 addresses. One of the largest cloud providers, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) has announced that [their users will now need to pay 44 US$ per year per public IPv4 address](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/) that they use in the AWS cloud. This could be significant for some services and will probably encourage them to move to dual-stack to support IPv6 and IPv4 and then later remove IPv4 to simplify the service.
