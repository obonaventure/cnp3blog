Open DNS resolvers such as Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 or Google's 8.8.8.8 are quite popular. An ISOC [blog post](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/blog/lessons-from-the-cloudflare-1-1-1-1-outage-a-resilience-perspective) explores some of the
lessons from a [recent failure of Cloudflare's open DNS resolver](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-1-1-1-1-incident-on-july-14-2025/). Anurag Bhatia also explores this outage on his [blog](https://anuragbhatia.com/post/2025/07/cloudflare-dns-outage/).

Webservers suffer from the load caused by AI bots that try to collect has many data as possible to train their models. An entire session of the MAPRG working group at the IETF was dedicated to this problem. Wikipedia [suffers a lot](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/) from these bots. In a [blog post](https://andrewkchan.dev/posts/crawler.html), Andrew Chan shows that it is possible to collect one billion web pages in 24 hours for a cost of 580 US$... The surge of AI bots is unlikely to stop soon... In the mean time, Cloudflare announced an [AI labyrinth](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/) to trap misbehaving AI bots.

In an interesting [blog post](https://blog.apnic.net/2025/07/02/bootstrapping-http-1-1-http-2-and-http-3/), Jan Schaumann clearly explains how web servers can be configured to encourage clients to use a specific version of HTTP.

David Redekop describes on the [ADAM blog](https://support.adamnet.works/t/dns-txt-records-the-swiss-army-knife-of-domain-data-versatile-vulnerable-and-how-to-sheath-the-blade-safely/1456) many of the popular utilizations of the DNS TXT records. Unfortunately, some of these records are also used to distribute [malware](https://dti.domaintools.com/malware-in-dns/). Another analysis of the DNS TXT records appeared on the [RIPE blog](https://labs.ripe.net/author/pgl/the-joy-of-txt/) in 2023.

Another less used DNS record is the LOC record that provides location information. A [blog post](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/get-the-location-of-the-iss-using-dns/) shows that you can query the LOC record of where-is-the-iss.dedyn.io to find the current location of the International Space Station.

```
dig +short where-is-the-iss.dedyn.io LOC

51 34 44.060 S 18 40 22.060 W 431570.00m 10000m 10000m 10000m

On July 24, 2025, Starlink suffered from an outage. The [ThousandEyes blog](https://www.thousandeyes.com/blog/starlink-outage-analysis-july-24-2025) explores this outage from Internet data and reveals some interesting information about the Starlink network. 

Denial of Service attacks continue to grow. The last reported peak attack used [7.3 Tbps of traffic](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/).
