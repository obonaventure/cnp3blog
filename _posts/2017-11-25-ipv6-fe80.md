Link local addresses play an important role in IPv6 since they enable hosts 
that are attached to the same subnet to directly exchange packets without
requiring any configuration. When an IPv6 host or router boots, the
first thing that it tries to do is to create a link-local address for
each of its interfaces. It is interesting to observe how those link-local
addresses are used in a very simple network. 

We consider the most basic topology containing two hosts connected to
one router:

```console
                                                                     
  h1 ---- r ---- h2                                                                             
```

With [IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet), this network can be created with a simple [script](https://github.com/obonaventure/RoutingExamples/blob/master/static/noip.py)

```python
import ipmininet
from ipmininet.cli import IPCLI
from ipmininet.ipnet import IPNet
from ipmininet.router.config import RouterConfig
from ipmininet.iptopo import IPTopo
from mininet.log import lg

class NoIP(IPTopo):

    def build(self, *args, **kwargs):
        r = self.addRouter_v6('r', config=(RouterConfig))
        h1 = self.addHost('h1')
        h2 = self.addHost('h2')
        self.addLink(r, h1)
        self.addLink(r, h2)

    def addRouter_v6(self, name, **kwargs):
        return self.addRouter(name, use_v4=False, use_v6=True, **kwargs)

ipmininet.DEBUG_FLAG = True
lg.setLogLevel("info")

# Start network
net = IPNet(topo=NoIP(), use_v4=False, allocate_IPs=False)

try:
    net.start()
    IPCLI(net)
finally:
    net.stop()

```

In this network, the simplest way to observe what happens when a host is
attached to the network is to collect packet traces on the router with [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org). 

```console
tcpdump -i r-eth0 -n -vvv 
```

Once packet capture has started, we can force a reconfiguration of host `h1`
manually by setting its interface down and up.

```console
#ip link show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: h1-eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether aa:a3:b6:e6:4b:1e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
```

Host `h1` has two interfaces: a loopback and an Ethernet interface attached to router `r`. We disable the interface `h1-eth0` with the command ` ip link set h1-eth0 down`. At this point, the only remaining interface is the loopback interface.

We can now activate the `h1-eth0` interface with command ` ip link set h1-eth0 up ` and observe the packets that are sent by `h1` via `tcpdump` on the router.

Once the link goes up, `h1` automatically creates a link-local address
and attaches it to interface `h1-eth0`. 

```console
# ip -6 addr show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 state UNKNOWN qlen 1
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: h1-eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 state UP qlen 1000
    inet6 fe80::a8a3:b6ff:fee6:4b1e/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

This link-local address is created by concatenating the well-known `fe80::/64` 
prefix specified in section [2.5.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.6) of [RFC4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291) with the 
64 bits interface identifier. This identifier is constructed from the
MAC address of the interface.

```console
#ip link show h1-eth0
2: h1-eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether aa:a3:b6:e6:4b:1e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
```

The creation of the interface identifier from MAC address `aa:a3:b6:e6:4b:1e` 
is specified
in [section 2.5.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.1) of
[RFC4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291).  The resulting
link-local address is `fe80::a8a3:b6ff:fee6:4b1e`.

At this stage, host `h1` needs to verify that no other device is using the
same link-local address on the subnet. `tcpdump` running on the router observes
the following packet:

```console

09:40:33.938113 IP6 (hlim 255, next-header ICMPv6 (58) payload length: 24) :: > ff02::1:ffe6:4b1e: [icmp6 sum ok] ICMP6, neighbor solicitation, length 24, who has fe80::a8a3:b6ff:fee6:4b1e

```

There are several points to note about this packet. First, its source IPv6 
address is set to `::`, i.e. a block of 128 bits set to zero. This is the
unspecified address defined in [section 2.5.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.2) of [RFC4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291). This
address must be used as a source address when a device does not have a
link-local address. The destination address is `ff02::1` (there is a problem
in the tcpdump output shown above which is likely caused by the utilisation
of virtual interfaces on mininet) which is the reserved
IPv6 multicast address for all IPv6 hosts.

After some time without a response to this neighbor sollicitation, host
`h1` considers that its link-local address is unique. It can then send an
ICMPv6 router sollicitation message.

```console
09:40:34.956122 IP6 (hlim 255, next-header ICMPv6 (58) payload length: 16) fe80::a8a3:b6ff:fee6:4b1e > ff02::2: [icmp6 sum ok] ICMP6, router solicitation, length 16
          source link-address option (1), length 8 (1): aa:a3:b6:e6:4b:1e
            0x0000:  aaa3 b6e6 4b1e

```

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-4.6.1

This ICMPv6 router sollicitation is sent from the link-local address of host `h1`which is now considered as unique. The destination is `ff02::2` which corresponds to all IPv6 routers. This router sollication message contains the MAC address
of the sender inside the source link-address option defined in [section 4.6.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-4.6.1) of [RFC4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861).

As no router has been configured to send router advertisements in this network,
host `h1` will not receive any answer. According to [RFC4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861), it should retransmit the router sollicitation message
up to 3 times with a delay of 4 seconds between retransmissions (see sections 
[10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-10) and [6.3.7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861#section-6.3.7) of RFC4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)
