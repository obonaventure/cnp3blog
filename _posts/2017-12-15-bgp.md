[IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet) supports various routing protocols. In this post,
we use it to study how the Border Gateway Protocol operates in a simple network containing only
BGP routers. Our virtual lab contains four routers and four hosts:


```console

                     h2
                     ||
       h1 = ra ----- rb ----- rd = h4
            |        |
            +------ rc = h3
```

The [IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet) script for this lab is available
from [https://github.com/obonaventure/RoutingExamples/blob/master/bgp/simple-bgp.py](https://github.com/obonaventure/RoutingExamples/blob/master/bgp/simple-bgp.py). There are four main parts in the definition of this topology.

First, we create the BGP routers and specify the prefixes that each router advertises.

```python

        # BGP routers

        as1ra = self.bgp('as1ra',['2001:1234:1::/64'])
        as2rb = self.bgp('as2rb',['2001:1234:2::/64'])
        as3rc = self.bgp('as3rc',['2001:1234:3::/64'])
        as4rd = self.bgp('as4rd',['2001:1234:4::/64'])
```

The first router, `as1ra` will use BGP to advertise prefix `2001:1234:1::/64` that is
assigned to the LAN containing host `h1`. Then, we associate each router to an
Autonomous System.

```python
       # Set AS-ownerships

        self.addOverlay(AS(1, (as1ra,)))
        self.addOverlay(AS(2, (as2rb,)))
        self.addOverlay(AS(3, (as3rc,)))
        self.addOverlay(AS(4, (as4rd,)))
```

This information is used by [IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet) to
create the BGP configuration for the [Quagga dameon](http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/docs/quagga.html).
We can then create the links between the different routers. We configure each interdomain link with
its own IPv6 prefix. Kato and Manning have proposed to use [link-local addresses for the eBGP sessions](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kato-bgp-ipv6-link-local-00) and several vendors have implemented this feature, but we do not analyse it here.

```python 

 # Inter-AS links

        self.addLink(as1ra, as2rb,                      
                     params1={"ip": "2001:12::a/64"},
                     params2={"ip": "2001:12::b/64"})
        self.addLink(as1ra, as3rc,                      
                     params1={"ip": "2001:13::a/64"},
                     params2={"ip": "2001:13::c/64"})
        self.addLink(as2rb, as3rc,                      
                     params1={"ip": "2001:23::b/64"},
                     params2={"ip": "2001:23::c/64"})
        self.addLink(as2rb, as4rd,                      
                     params1={"ip": "2001:24::c/64"},
                     params2={"ip": "2001:24::d/64"})

```

The topology and the IPv6 addresses have been allocated. We can now create the peering links.

```python

        # Add eBGP peering
        bgp_peering(self, as1ra, as2rb)
        bgp_peering(self, as1ra, as3rc)
        bgp_peering(self, as2rb, as3rc)
        bgp_peering(self, as2rb, as4rd)

```

These methods create the configuration files for the Quagga BGP daemon based on the parameters that we
have passed. For example, let us look at the BGP configuration file for `as1ra`.

```console
hostname as1ra
password zebra

log file /tmp/bgpd_as1ra.log


router bgp 1
    bgp router-id 0.0.0.2
    bgp bestpath compare-routerid
    no auto-summary
    neighbor 2001:12::b remote-as 2
    neighbor 2001:12::b port 179
    neighbor 2001:12::b description as2rb (eBGP)
    neighbor 2001:12::b ebgp-multihop
    
    no auto-summary
    neighbor 2001:13::c remote-as 3
    neighbor 2001:13::c port 179
    neighbor 2001:13::c description as3rc (eBGP)
    neighbor 2001:13::c ebgp-multihop
    
    address-family ipv6
    network 2001:1234:1::/64
    neighbor 2001:12::b activate
    neighbor 2001:12::b next-hop-self all
    neighbor 2001:13::c activate
    neighbor 2001:13::c next-hop-self all
    exit-address-family
    !

!
```

After having defined the `hostname`, default password and log file, we start the BGP part of the configuration
by indicating the AS number of `as1ra` with `router bgp 1`. The next line specifies the `router-id` of the 
BGP router. Each BGP router must have a unique router-id which is usually one of its IPv4 addresses.
In our examples, we do not assign IPv4 addresses to the routers and  [IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet)
automatically assigns router-id `0.0.0.2` to `as1ra`. The lines starting with the `neighbor` commands define the
eBGP sessions between `as1ra` and `as2rb` and `as3rc`. Each session is an external BGP session and uses port
179 which is the standard BGP port. The last part of the configuration specifies that router `as1ra` will advertise
the `2001:1234:1::/64` IPv6 prefix.

We can now start the network with ` sudo python bgp/simple-bgp.py `. Let us first check that all hosts can reach the others.
The lastest version of [IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet) includes an updated version of the
`pingall` command which supports IPv4 and IPv6.

```console

mininet>pingall
*** Ping: testing reachability over IPv4 and IPv6
h1 --IPv6--> h4 h3 h2 
h2 --IPv6--> h4 h1 h3 
h3 --IPv6--> h4 h1 h2 
h4 --IPv6--> h1 h2 h3 
*** Results: 0% dropped (12/12 received)
```

This confirms that the network works well. We can verify some of the paths by using `traceroute6`.

```console
mininet> h1 traceroute6 h2
traceroute to 2001:1234:2::2 (2001:1234:2::2) from 2001:1234:1::1, 30 hops max, 16 byte packets

 4  2001:1234:1::1 (2001:1234:1::1)  0.043 ms  0.087 ms  0.048 ms
```

The BGP daemon which runs on each router provides a command line interface (CLI) which can be used
to issue commands but also to check the status of the routing protocols. We can start
this CLI with `telnet ::1 bgpd`. In this command, `bgpd` is translated into port number 2605 which is 
defined in the `/etc/services` file on `as1ra`.


```mininet> as1ra telnet ::1 bgpd
Trying ::1...
Connected to ::1.

A first command is `show bgp summary` which outputs a summary of the status of the BGP
sessions on the local router.

```console
as1ra> sh bgp summary 

...

The output is verbose. We only list above the information related to the IPv6 routes
that we use. The two eBGP sessions that we have defined in the configuration are
active and 3 prefixes have been learned from each of these sessions.

We can obtain more information about the BGP sessions with the `show bgp neighbors` command.

```console

Another very important command is `show ipv6 bgp`. It outputs the BGP routing
table of the router.

```console

Displayed  4 out of 7 total prefixes
```

It is important to understand the information in the BGP routing table. The first prefix,
`2001:1234:1::/64` is the one which is originated by `as1ra`. Its origin is
marked as being interal (see character `i` at the end of the line`). The first prefix
that we learn from BGP is `2001:1234:2::/64`. `as1ra` has received two paths
for this prefix : `AS3:AS2` via router `as3rc` (nexthop `2001:13::c`) and
`AS2` via router `as2rb` (nexthop `2001:12::b`). According to the [BGP Decision Process](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/2nd/html/protocols/bgp.html#the-bgp-decision-process), the path via `as2rb` is preferred since it has
the shortes AS-Path. The `*` at the beginning of each line indicates that the paths
are valid and the `>`character indicates the best path which is installed in the FIB
and used to forwarded data plane packets. Prefix `2001:1234:3::/64` is learned from
both `as2rb` and `as3rc` and the latter path is preferred. Prefix `2001:1234:4::/64` is
learned from both `as2rb` and `as3rc` and in this case the former is preffered.

Once the BGP sessions are up, it is interesting to observe the BGP messages that are exchanged. 
Routers only exchange BGP routes when they changed. In our stable topology, we only observe BGP Update
messages when sessions are created or stopped. The most frequent BGP messages that we can
observe are the BGP Keepalive messages that are exchanged regularly between routers to
check that the BGP sessions remain up. As an example, here are the BGP Update messages
observed on the BGP session between `as1ra` and `as2rb`.

```console

```

Looking at the timing between the messages, we can easily observe that BGP Keepalive messages are
exchanged every minute. This is the default timer period with our version of Quagga.

Let us now explore what happens when we disable the link between `as1ra` and `as2rb`. For this, we 
execute ` ip link set dev as2rb-eth0 down` on router `as2rb` and observe the impact of
this command on router `as1ra`. After having issued this command the link between the
two routers appears to freeze as it does not anymore carry packets. If we run
`traceroute6` from host `h1`, we see clearly that the packets have been rerouted
via router `as3rc`.

```console
mininet> h1 traceroute6 h4
traceroute to 2001:1234:4::4 (2001:1234:4::4) from 2001:1234:1::1, 30 hops max, 16 byte packets
 1  2001:1234:1::a (2001:1234:1::a)  0.056 ms  0.04 ms  0.016 ms
 2  2001:13::c (2001:13::c)  0.025 ms  0.025 ms  0.022 ms
 3  2001:23::b (2001:23::b)  0.023 ms  0.095 ms  0.085 ms
 4  2001:24::d (2001:24::d)  0.051 ms  0.033 ms  0.019 ms
 5  2001:1234:4::4 (2001:1234:4::4)  0.025 ms  0.028 ms  0.017 ms
```

To understand the reason for this change of route, let us look at the content of
the BGP routing table on `as1ra`:

```console
as1ra> sh ipv6 bgp
BGP table version is 0, local router ID is 0.0.0.2
Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,

```

The routes that were learned form `as2rb` are still part of the BGP routing table, but
they are now marked as invalid (the corresponding line does not contain the 
`*` character anymore. BGP considers these routes to be invalid because `as1ra` does
not know how to reach the corresponding BGP nexthop (`2001:12::b`). If we look at the
FIB on router `as1ra`, we clearly observe that the router does not have a route
to reach prefis `2001:12::b/64`.

```console
mininet> as1ra ip -6 route

If we look at the packets on the `as1ra`-`as2rb` link, we observe the last packets
excahnged on this link:

```console
 
14:19:40.125910 IP6 (class 0xc0, flowlabel 0x67094, hlim 255, next-header TCP (6) payload length: 51) 2001:12::b.54230 > 2001:12::a.179: Flags [P.], cksum 0x4074 (incorrect -> 0xe912), seq 2604:2623, ack 2622, win 59, options [nop,nop,TS val 7294331 ecr 7294330], length 19: BGP
        Keepalive Message (4), length: 19
14:19:40.166495 IP6 (class 0xc0, flowlabel 0x147fb, hlim 255, next-header TCP (6) payload length: 32) 2001:12::a.179 > 2001:12::b.54230: Flags [.], cksum 0x4061 (incorrect -> 0xed21), seq 2622, ack 2623, win 60, options [nop,nop,TS val 7294341 ecr 7294331], length 0

```

A close look at the logs of `as1ra1` shows that the BGP session between `as1ra` and `as2rb` was considered to
be down 3 minutes after the link became down. This is by default BGP sends BGP Keepalive messages every
60 seconds and considers the session to be down when it has not received any response to three successive
BGP Keepalive messages.

```console
mininet> as1ra tail /tmp/bgpd_as1ra.log 
2017/12/15 14:22:40 BGP: %NOTIFICATION: sent to neighbor 2001:12::b 4/0 (Hold Timer Expired) 0 bytes 
2017/12/15 14:22:40 BGP: Notification sent to neighbor 2001:12::b:0: type 4/0
2017/12/15 14:22:40 BGP: %ADJCHANGE: neighbor 2001:12::b Down BGP Notification send
2017/12/15 14:28:00 BGP: Vty connection from ::1
```

This is confirmed by the BGP summary that shows that router `as1ra` is trying to reestablish
the session with `as2rb`.

```console
as1ra> sh bgp summary 

IPv6 Unicast Summary:
---------------------
BGP router identifier 0.0.0.2, local AS number 1
RIB entries 7, using 504 bytes of memory

```

At this point, we can re-enable the link between the two routers with
`ip link set dev as2rb-eth0 up` and reconfigure the static address
on `as2rb` with `ip -6 addr add 2001:12::b/64 dev as2rb-eth0`. Shortly after, the
two routers attempt again to restablish the session between themselves.

A BGP session is always established over a TCP connection. We thus observe first
the three-handshake that establishes the TCP connection on port 179:

 ```

The first BGP message that we observe is the `Open` message which provides basic information about
the session and allows to advertise that are supported by the initiating router
(in this case, `as1ra`). The router provides the BGP version (4), its AS number (1), the
timer to consider a session to be down (180s) and its router id. It also advertise
optional capabilities, including the ability to support IPv6.

`as2rb` replies with a BGP message that contains its AS number (2), hold timer, router-id
and optional capabilities. This message also contains a keepalive.

```console

```

We can then observe the BGP Update messages that advertise routes. `as1ra` is the first
to send its update:

For efficiency reasons, BGP packs multiple update messages in the same TCP segment. Here, we can obser the
different prefixes, their nexthops and the associated AS Path. Quagga advertises both the IPv6 address and the link-local address for each nexthop. `as2rb` sends its BGP Update shortly after:

```console

Shortly after, we observe two additional messages where `as1ra` withdraws the routes for
`2001:1234:2::/64` and `2001:1234:4::/64` because its best path to reach this destination
is now the path via `as2rb`.

```console

            0x0010:  3400 0400 00
```

We can confirm this by looking at the BGP routing table of `as1ra`:

```console
as1ra> sh bgp ipv6
BGP table version is 0, local router ID is 0.0.0.2
Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,
              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed

`as2rb` also sends a withdraw for prefix `2001:1234:1::/64` for similar reasons.

```console
14:45:29.458229 IP6 (class 0xc0, flowlabel 0x43cfb, hlim 255, next-header TCP (6) payload length: 71) 2001:12::b.179 > 2001:12::a.38394: Flags [P.], cksum 0x4088 (incorrect -> 0x98db), seq 529:568, ack 585, win 58, options [nop,nop,TS val 7681664 ecr 7681664], length 39: BGP
        Update Message (2), length: 39
          Multi-Protocol Unreach NLRI (15), length: 12, Flags [OE]: 
            AFI: IPv6 (2), SAFI: Unicast (1)
              2001:1234:1::/64
            0x0000:  0002 0140 2001 1234 0001 0000
```


At this point, the BGP session between the two routers is stable and only Keepalive messages are exchanged.
