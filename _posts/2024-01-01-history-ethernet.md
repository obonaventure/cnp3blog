The Internet plays an important role in our society. Jim Cowie 
wrote [an interesting blog post](https://content.cooperate.com/post/internet_history/) where he discusses what needs to be done to preserve history about the Internet infrastructure including archived BGP messages, traceroute information and other artifacts about the Internet infrastructure.


The [Internet Protocol Journal](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com/) is a highly
recommended resource for networking students. Every issue of this journal publishes
tutorial articles on various networking topics. The last issue provides an Introduction to 5G, a discussion on why Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) did not succeed and the 20 first years of cellular/Wi-Fi integration.

Ethernet is the most successful Local Area Network technology. It has been more
widely deployed than the dreams of its designers. When the first Ethernet memo was
published at Xerox, several co-workers had doubts about the success of Ethernet.

In parallel, [Ken Shirriff shared on X](https://x.com/kenshirriff/status/1741524789896884349?s=61&t=tP_GnIXAFXsfnvztGctEig) a thread about the design of
AMD LANCE chipset that equipped many Ethernet adapters.

Some network engineers refer to the [Border Gateway Protocol](https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/protocols/bgp.html?highlight=bgp) as
the two napkins protocol because its early design was written on a napkin during
lunch. The original napkin has been preserved a the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org). [Flavio Luciani shared on X](https://x.com/flavioluciani81/status/1740431107395367315?s=12&t=tP_GnIXAFXsfnvztGctEig) a copy of
these historical napkins that are reproduced below.
