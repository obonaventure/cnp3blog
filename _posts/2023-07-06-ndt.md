title: Do we really need to accurately measure fiber access links ?

Internet Service Providers that serve end users like to use metrics
to compare their service with their competitors. For many years,
maximum throughput has been the metric of choice among ISPs. When
dial-up links were popular a 56 kbps connections made a difference
with a 34 kbps one. The same applied with the early deployments
of xDSL and cable networks.

This obsession for throughput encouraged vendors and operators to
deploy new access technologies that are now capable of
reaching several Gbps to the home. In parallel with this deployment
various techniques have been proposed to accurately measure the
throughput of Internet connections: [speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/),
[fast.com](https://fast.com/), [speed.cloudflare.com](https://speed.cloudflare.com),
[nperf.com](https://nperf.com) or [Measurement Lab's NDT](https://www.measurementlab.net/tests/ndt/).

These measurement techniques typically try to saturate the user's access link
to estimate the maximum throughput that can be reached. With speeds
above 1 Gbps, this poses a challenge to the servers that perform these
measurements and [Measurement Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/) recently
announced that it would introduce [data transfer limits in NDT](https://www.measurementlab.net/blog/short-ndt/#introducing-data-transfer-limits-to-ndt).

This is a first step, but in the long term we need to reevaluate how
we assess the performance of an Internet access link. With access
link bandwidth above 100 Mbps, very few users are able to fully utilize
their access link with real applications. With a very high bandwidth
access link, delay, packet losses and the reliability of the link
become much more important metrics that needs to be measured.
