The web was designed in the 20th century as a decentralised technique to
freely share information. The initial audience for the web protocols were
scientific researchers who needed to share scientific documents. HTTP
was designed as a stateless protocol and Netscape added [HTTP cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to ease e-commerce. These cookies play
a crucial role in today's ad-supported Internet. They have also enabled
companies like Google or Facebook to collect huge amount of data about the
browsing habits of almost all Internet users in order to deliver targeted
advertisements.

Ad-paid content is not the only possible business model for publishing
content on the Internet. There are various examples of websites that publish
quality content without relying on advertisements and forcing their users
to expose their privacy to access this content. Some content providers
explore solutions like [Flattr](https://flattr.com) [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) or donations in Bitcoins.

Apple's iOS11 might encourage more content providers to explore alternatives
to exposing their reader's privacy. With the release of iOS11, Safari will
limit the lifetime of [HTTP Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to limit the associated privacy leaks. Four large American Advertisement
associations have argued against Apple's approach in an [open letter](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/major-ad-trade-groups-release-joint-letter-outlining-deep-concerns-over-cookie-handling-functionality-of-apples-safari-11-browser-300519829.html) and [arstechnica.com](https://arstechnica.com) has 
published an [article](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/major-ad-trade-groups-release-joint-letter-outlining-deep-concerns-over-cookie-handling-functionality-of-apples-safari-11-browser-300519829.html) summarising those issues.
