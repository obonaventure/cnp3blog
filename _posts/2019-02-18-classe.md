title: Using Class E IPv4 addresses, the return of a bad idea
tag: IPv4

The IPv4 addressing space was initially designed as being divided in
four classes of addresses. [RFC791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791) clearly defined those
classes of addresses as follows:

![RFC791]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/class-addr.png)

Later, [RFC1112](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112) updated this
addressing space to further divide the fourth class in two parts:

   *Host groups are identified by class D IP addresses, i.e., those with
   "1110" as their high-order four bits.  Class E IP addresses, i.e.,
   those with "1111" as their high-order four bits, are reserved for
   future addressing modes.*

Later, [RFC1519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1519) updated the addressing space to remove the division of the addresses in classes.
Since then, IPv4 supports variable length subnets that have enabled
it to continue to be deployed until using all available unicast IPv4
addresses have been allocated.

Various researchers have explored the real utilisation of the IPv4
addressing space. An interesting analysis appeared in
[A primer on IPv4 scarcity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2649.pdf). In
particular, the figure below extracted from this paper shows the
evolution of the routable IPv4 space based on the BGP routes that are
announced. It clearly shows that besides the large blocks of unannounced IPv4 addresses in the former class A addresses, most of
the available IPv4 addresses are announced.

Given the scarcity of the IPv4 addresses, a market for IPv4 addresses
has emerged. The companies that were allocated a large block of
IPv4 addresses consider this as an asset and some have started
to sell their IPv4 addresses like their Intellectual Property.
For example, Microsoft agreed to [pay 7.5 million US$ to buy
the 666,624 IPv4 addresses allocated to Nortel when it went bankrupt](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2228854/microsoft-subnet/microsoft-pays-nortel--7-5-million-for-ipv4-addresses.html).
Today, the price for a block of IPv4 addresses is probably higher and
some organisations continues to hold blocks of IPv4 addresses without fully using them. The United States Department of Defense owns [13 /8
blocks of IPv4 addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks), making them the larger user of IP addresses in the world.

In the long term, investing in IPv4 is not the right approach.
Everybody agrees that the long term solution is to continue
to deploy IPv6. According to the statistics collected by Google,
more than one fourth of its users use IPv6 in January 2019.

Unfortunately, some continue to believe in IPv4 and spent time
in trying to extend the lifetime of this old technology. The last
example is a forthcoming presentation at [Netdev 0x13]((https://www.netdevconf.org/0x13/) on [Potnetial IPv4 Unicast Expansions](https://www.netdevconf.org/0x13/session.html?talk-ipv4-unicast-expansions). Their idea is very simple: reuse the Class E IPv4 addressing space to support regular unicast IPv4 packets. This idea has already been proposed several times in the past and never been
finalised given the complexity of ensuring that a sufficient fraction of the Internet routers and hosts would be capable of forwarding those packets correctly. Unfortunately, they apparently managed to convince some router vendors and even the maintainers of the Linux kernel to accept their patches.

Instead of spending time and effort for therapeutic relentlessness on IPv4, deploy IPv6. You will obtain a stronger return on investment by migrating to an IPv6 only network than by continuing to rely on historic technology.
