There are many ways to wire Ethernet networks. When students create
simple labs with a few cables and a few switches and a few hosts, they
simply plug any suitable cable and run their experiment. In real
networks, a good wiring strategy can help to avoid lots of problems
and lost time debugging those problems.

A recent discussion on twitter showed two photos that easily illustrate
the difference between a good and a bad wiring strategy.

Let's start with the good strategy, posted by

Shortly after, [@brian_jorden](https://twitter.com/brian_jorden)
showed another strategy that he saw in a real network. I remember
seeing a similar strategy at a smaller scale in our CS
Department several years ago ...

The cable layout is visually better in the good wiring strategy, but
if you zoom on the Ethernet cables, you will observe that each of them
has a label with a number attached at both ends of the cable. With
these labels, you can verify that the two endpoints of a cable are
correct. The best wirers go one step further by documenting each
installed cable, with its labels and endpoints, in a database that is
updated after every wiring change. It takes time every time some
changes a cable, but network operators win a lot of precious time when
the network is in trouble and problems need to be debugged.
