Networks are composed of cables and equipment whose normal utilisation is sometimes
disrupted by animals that view them from a different angle than humans. Fiber optic
cables that are laid under the sea to connect continents attract a variety of
animals. Sharks can be attracted by the shape of the cable or the magnetic fields
that they emit. One of these [cable biting sharks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMxkRh7sx84) 
has even been stopped by under the sea surveillance cameras...

Sharks are not the only animals to cause networking problems. Squirrels have also
some habits which can interfere with the operation of networking equipment. Squirrels
like to hide food during the summer to be able to recover it during the winter and one
of maybe several of them have found [a very unexpected food bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAeh80fKe7U)...

Some squirrels help network engineers to maintain the network and ensure that cables
do not break during the winter as shown by this [other example](http://www.wideopenspaces.com/powerline-snowplow-squirrel-simply-wont-stopped/)
