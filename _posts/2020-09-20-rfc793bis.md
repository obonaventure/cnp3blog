title: A consolidated TCP specification

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the most important protocols used on the Internet. The first TCP specification was published in [RFC793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) in September 1981. During the last 39 years, TCP has been regularly improved without a revision of [RFC793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793). In 2013, Wesley Eddy started to work on [rfc793bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-eddy-rfc793bis/00/). After almost two years, the [TCPM IETF working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tcpm/documents/) decided to adopt this effort. Five years later, we now have a consolidated version of the updated version of [RFC793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793).

A last call has been issued for the new document, [draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc793bits](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis/?include_text=1). This last call means that the working group members will review the document and provide the final feedback, hopefully before an IETF-wide last call and the publication of this version. If everything goes well, the revised version of [RFC793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) could be officially published before the 40th anniversary of [RFC793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793). Note that this document still does not contain congestion control or the different TCP extensions that are specified in existing RFCs.
