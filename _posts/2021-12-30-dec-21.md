Welcome to the January 2022 edition of the Networking Notes newsletter.

This newsletter gathers the most recent news about the evolution
of the networking field. Its main objective is to inform the students
who have read the [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols, and Practice](https://www.computer-networking.info) ebook about the evolution of the field.

You can [subscribe](https://blog.computer-networking.info/notes/) to receive this newsletter in your mailbox every month.

# Generic networking

## Web3

The web3 proponents argue that the future of the web lies in using cryptocurrency and blockchain for future web services. Nick Weaver [convincingly explains](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/web3-fraud) why such an approach is doomed to fail. 

## Failures

Networks are supposed to operate 24/7 without any interruption, but some of their components fails. Documenting these failures is important to prevent them in the future.

Urs Holze documents the [failure of a 100 Tbps fiber links in South Carolina due to a fire in a rural area](https://twitter.com/uhoelzle/status/1471926400449871875?s=12). Capacity was restored within 12 hours.



# Network protocols

## Application layer

Starting with iOS15, Apple has added a private relay service that enables users of Apple devices to surf via Apple's relay servers. This is intended to improve the user's privacy. Apple recently released [a technical report](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iCloud_Private_Relay_Overview_Dec2021.PDF) describing this new service.

### DNS

Erik Rescorla has published three very interesting blog posts on DNS Security, see:
- [DNS Security, part 1: Basic DNS](https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/dns-security/)
- [DNS Security, part 2: DNSSEC](https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/dns-security-dnssec/)
- [DNS Security, part 3: DANE and the WebPKI](https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/dns-security-dane/)


### HTTP


### Security



## Transport layer

### QUIC

### TCP

## Networking layer

### IP

Network Address Translation (NAT) was designed for IPv4, but there are also various use cases for NAT in IPv6 as well as summarised by [infoblox](https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/you-thought-there-was-no-nat-for-ipv6-but-nat-still-exists/)

### Interdomain routing (BGP)

## Mobile networks

The first 5G networks start to be deployed. Various companies measure their performance, including [speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/state-of-worldwide-5g-2021/).

## Physical layer

Today's networks heavily rely on optical fibers. This is currently the most powerful link layer technology. Given its large scale deploment, scientists have started to use optical fibers for [non-data transmission use cases](https://www.science.org/content/article/cheap-and-rugged-optical-fibers-are-revealing-earth-s-hidden-motions#.YbRu21IjV9o.twitter), including detecting earthquakes, monitoring volcanoes, ...


# Software and tools

Starlink aims at providing better Internet access in rural areas using low orbit satellites. Oleg Kutkov provides a [detailed reverse engineering of the originial Starlink router on his blog](https://olegkutkov.me/2021/12/25/analysis-and-reverse-engineering-of-the-original-starlink-router/)

DNS configuration can be complex and only few system administrators maintain DNS configurations. The [https://messwithdns.net/](https://messwithdns.net/) website allows students to experiment and configure their own DNS records. A possible lab for a networking course.
