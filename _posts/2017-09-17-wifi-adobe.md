mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) to access websites.

Another interesting result is the impact of [Google AMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages) which continues to grow. AMP is a
proprietary solution that allows to accelerate the web page loading times
on mobiles. Using a non-standard approach has generated some debate and
some content publishers have decided to [stop using it](https://www.alexkras.com/i-decided-to-disable-amp-on-my-site/).
