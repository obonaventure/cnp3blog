Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to more and more use cases including networking. The [networking channel](https://networkingchannel.eu) recently organized two interesting discussions on AI techniques. Jean-Philippe Vasseur gave a talk on [Are we living the long-awaited AI revolution for Networking with Generative AI](https://networkingchannel.eu/are-we-living-the-long-awaited-ai-revolution-for-networking-with-generative-ai-downloads/) while Vishal Misra discussed on [Integrating LLMs in Computer Networking Education: can it be done ? what are the challenges ?](https://networkingchannel.eu/llms-in-computer-networking-education-can-it-be-done-what-are-the-challenges-downloads/). These two talks and the associated discussion are are good starting point to explore the interactions between AI and networking.

The [Internet Protocol Journal](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com) published its [March 2024 issue](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com) with two main articles:

 - an introduction to network slicing in 5G networks by William Stallings
 - an article by Mikael Holmberg on the history and the future of Ethernet

The [Internet Protocol Journal](https://ipj.dreamhosters.com) is highly recommended for all networking students and professionals.

Slicing is an important technique introduced in 5G networks. It leverages several existing networking techniques under a new name and in some deployments with a better coordination. The [IETF](https://www.ietf.org) recently published [RFC9543](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC9543) that precisely defines what the IETF considers as a network slice. This is an interesting document to understand what slicing and cannot provide.

Several [optical fibers were damaged in the Red Sea](https://theatlasnews.co/breakingnews/2024/03/14/multiple-african-nations-reporting-submarine-cables-cut-internet-outage-intensifies/). This is resulted in a large reduction of the traffic towards several African countries as [reported by Max Resing](https://infosec.exchange/@resingm/112098625835864162).

In a [short article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07828), Lucal Vogel, Thomas Springer and Watthias WÃ¤hlisch have summarized the evolution of HTTP during the last thirty years. They nicely summarize the different versions of HTTP and their deployment in a single figure.
